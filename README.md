# SSL Certificate Manager (ssl-certificate-manager) <img alt="Version" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.1.0-blue.svg?cacheSeconds=2592000" />

## Project description

Cross platform electron application to manage your fleet of SSL certificates.

For the moment it:

- allows importing a list of domain names (or individually add domains) to be processed
- checks the validity of the certificates for the domains
- can validate the certificates using public and local (installed on the computer) trusted certificates
- displays details about the certificates for each domain
  - validity status
  - fingerprint, issuer, subject, additional subjects for quick view (and all details in expanded view)
  - valability start and end time
  - errors encountered while validating
- keeps a history (and allow inspection) of previous different validation results
- allows exporting of the domains with the validation details

It will soon be able to:

- create a CSR (and key) from an existing certificate
- create certificate bundles
- show details about used TLS configuration and check against known bad practices
